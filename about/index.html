<h1>Oh hey, I'm glad you're here :)</h1>

<p> My name is <span class="p-name">Amber</span>. I come here to you from a modest background and a very, very typically English family. Spagetti on toast, turkey drumsticks and weather anyone? I have also lived in many other countries: NZ (family
    live there now), DE, NL (Master's in Child Psychology from here), ES, PL. I love to travel, especially where the nature rocks - e.g. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rY5oZJ3PbBs&t=1s">Iceland</a>. </p>Since I was little, I've been fascinated by nature and design. Stick me in a pretty spot
outdoors and I will be content for hours appreciating the designs nature has to offer.
<p> I want to build my web dev, programming, and design (UI/UX) skills and am endeavouring to do so without formal tutoring. <strong>Update</strong> (07.04.17) - through my efforts I've been offered an internship at a design agency. Yay!
</p>I am currently interested in so many things - HTML/CSS/JS, UX, animation, start-ups, apps, graphic design.
I have loads to learn and am already making great coding friends from so many different backgrounds thanks to <a href="http://codebar.io" target='_blank'>codebar</a>. Cheers to learning and growing together :)
