			<p>I am Alison Hill Campbell, a freelance translator working from
				<strong>French</strong> and
				<strong>Portuguese</strong> into
				<strong>English</strong>.
			</p>

		<div class="main-section">
			<h2>About me</h2>
			<p>Established since
				<strong>2008</strong>, after I completed my MA in
				<strong>Translation and Linguistics</strong> at the University of Westminster, London.</p>
			<p> A background in the insurance industry working in overseas medical assistance and repatriations led me to specialise in
				translating documents in the field of
				<strong>medicine</strong> and
				<strong>pharmaceuticals</strong>.
			</p>
			<p>I became a qualified member of the
				<strong>Institute of Translation and interpreting (ITI)</strong> in 2014.
			</p>
			<h2>What I Do</h2>
			<p>Working for over 20 different clients since 2008, the types of texts I have translated include: </p>
			<ul>
				<li>Journal articles</li>
				<li>Patient reports</li>
				<li>Consent forms</li>
				<li>Patient information</li>
				<li>Package leaflets</li>
				<li>Summary of product characteristics (SMPC)</li>
				<li>Clinical trial documentation</li>
				<li>Adverse event reports</li>
				<li>Promotional material for medical products or devices</li>
			</ul>

			<p>These have covered the fields of oncology, orthopaedics, immunology, cardiology, neurology, radiology and, my particular
				interest, psychiatry. </p>
			<p>I can also take on
				<strong>certificate translation</strong> â€“ diplomas, birth/marriage/death certificates, and I offer certification for
				documents to be used in the UK.</p>


			<h2>Work With Me</h2>
