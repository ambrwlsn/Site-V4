        <h2>Who</h2>
        <p>I am a web developer with a Master's degree in psychology. I studied psychology because I love learning what makes
            people tick and helping them to lead happy lives.</p>
        <p>I've always had a huge love for science and for design. Growing up, I built websites, created things in PaintShop
            Pro, and edited thousands of photos in Photoshop.</p>
        <p>When I moved to <span class="p-locality">Brighton</span> in
            <time datetime="2016-06">June 2016</time>, I was instantly captivated by its creative community. Since then I have met so many people
            and achieved so much. I'm really excited that I'm able to build a career doing things I love and working with
            such great people.</p>

        <h2>What</h2>
        <p>My internship as a web developer helped me learn a lot about what I really like doing, how I like to work and how
            important it is for me and the people I work with to look out for and support each other. I am really interested
            in working as a developer in a company that will be happy to help me continue learning, and I want to give back
            to help the company achieve what they need.</p>
        <p>I tend to like working primarily on the frontend and with the UI (especially using HTML and CSS), and am interested
            in working a lot with JavaScript. I am also very interested in working with back end technologies and knowing
            how everything hooks up. </p>
        <p>Aside from this, I really do love learning everything and putting it all into practice. Whether it is front end,
            back end, best practices, semantic code, SOLID principles, documentation. Everything that goes into creating
            a successful product while working alongside a lovely team who also love to learn and try new things.</p>
        <p>Speaking of trying new things, I would love to work somewhere that has begun to use and work with new and emerging
            technologies such as AI, VR and machine learning.</p>
        <p>With my experience working in and studying psychology, I can provide a very useful perspective in my approach to
            development and the products I work on. I value communication and wellbeing in teams really highly and always
            want to look for ways to improve this by talking to people and reviewing how we work.</p>
