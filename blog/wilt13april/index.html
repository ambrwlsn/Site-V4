        </h2>
        <div class="e-content">

            <p>At <a href="https://clearleft.com">Clearleft</a> today, I ran through many new (and some familiar) things with
                <a href="https://adactio.com" rel="friend met">Jeremy</a>:

                <ul>

                    <li>We talked about <a href="https://adactio.com" rel="friend met">Jeremy</a>'s upcoming event - <a href="http://patternsday.com/">Patterns Day</a>                        (check out the site, it's nifty - also, buy a ticket!), to be held on June 30th. Jeremy kindly invited
                        me along and I'm really excited!</li>
                    <li>I found out where <a href="clearleft.com">Clearleft</a> got their idea for the 100 day challenge -
                        <a href="https://twitter.com/aaronpk">Aaron Parecki</a>'s <a href="https://100.aaronparecki.com/">100 days of music</a>!</li>
                    <li>I learned that these <em>amazing</em> <a href="http://www.colorfonts.wtf/">color fonts</a> won't be available
                        for a while (sadly).</li>
                    <li>I discovered a nice example of excellent forward-thinking. The creators of the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/CSS/font-weight">font-weight</a>                        CSS property use 100-700 for weighting type, not 1-7. This is because they anticipated that more
                        values could be utilised in the future. Now they can, with <a href="http://typographica.org/on-typography/variable-fonts/">variable fonts</a>.</li>
                    <li>Microformats <a href="http://microformats.org/wiki/existing-rel-values">rel values</a> (a question about
                        these sprung up when I coached at <a href="https://codebar.io">codebar</a> earlier in the week).</li>
                    <li>HTML5 <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html4/types.html#h-6.12">link types</a>.</li>
                    <li>XFN - The <a href="http://microformats.org/wiki/XFN">HTML5 Friends Network</a>. Jeremy has nice examples
                        on his own site including rel="friend" and rel="met" in his 'bedroll' section.</li>
                    <li>Examining what rel="canonical" does (it helps Google reference original publications).</li>
                    <li>Twitter <a href="https://cards-dev.twitter.com/validator">card validators</a>.</li>
                    <li>I completed <a href="http://cssgridgarden.com/">CSS Grid Garden</a>. It was really fun and I like the
                        specs a lot.</li>
                    <li>Jeremy has written things about <a href="https://adactio.com/links/tags/grid">CSS Grid</a>. We dove into
                        discussions about <a href="https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/complete-guide-grid/">Grid</a>, and
                        also <a href="https://flexbox.io/">Flexbox</a>. I learned how Grid and Flexbox were created by the
                        same people and share a lot of vocabulary. This means they can both be utilised in the same stylesheet
                        to suit different purposes.</li>
                    <li>I downloaded Firefox, as it has some nice developer tools for visualising a grid on the page.</li>
                    <li>I learned a little about product management in a 'brown bag' talk at <a href="https://clearleft.com">Clearleft</a>.
                        Very interesting learning about exercises to coordinate teams and define roles (including those of
                        clients) within a project and help everyone communicate better.</li>
                    <li>Talked with Jeremy about my upcoming <a href="https://web.material.is/2017/">Material</a> conference
                        talk. We brainstormed lots of great ideas that I wrote down. My next step is mindmapping to find
                        some golden connections between ideas.
                    </li>
                    <li>Chatted with Jeremy and Luke about roles that involve both front end development and UX. An area that
                        draws heavily on both roles is performance, particularly percieved performance.</li>
                    <li>Jeremy recommended some books on writing - including Steven Pinker's 'Sense of Style', particularly the
                        chapter on 'The Curse of Knowledge', and 'Bird by Bird' by Anne Lamott.</li>
                    <li>I learned of the <a href="https://openlibrary.org/">Open Library</a> where e-books are lent out free
                        of charge.</li>
                    <li>Talked with Jeremy and <a href="https://clearleft.com/team/hana-stevenson">Hannah</a> about <a href="/blog/cookies/">cookies</a>,
                        caching, and public speaking. </li>
                    <li>I was introduced to a number of very useful <a href="https://adactio.com/journal/9732">thought exercises</a>                        I can have a go at once I have some content for my talk.</li>
                    <li>I discovered Google's <a href="https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/insights/"> Page Speed Insights</a>                        tool for evaluating websites.</li>
                    <li>Jeremy set me homework - <a href="https://twitter.com/ambrwlsn90/status/852557145853833218">'What is the Difference Between HTTP and HTTPS?'</a></li>
                    <li>Jeremy suggested talks that could help me with mine from <a href="http://2017.render-conf.com/">Render Conference 2017</a>                        - Ana Balica's talk on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtTKF5OcpsU">HTTP</a> and Frances
                        Ng's
                        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Df0-2e6M_y4">rise from Aerospace Engineer to Front-End Engineer.</a>
                    </li>
                    <li>Jeremy introduced me to @supports in CSS, plus a neat way to <a href="https://fontfaceobserver.com/">load fonts</a>                        using JavaScript that improves perceived performance by customising font loading behaviour. </li>
                    <li>Jeremy showed me the difference between not using the font-loading method vs. using it. There was a really
                        large difference in perceived performance (font loading was better, despite the page loading slightly
                        slower). </li>
                    <li>Jeremy showed me 4 design boards (each from a different designer) that helped him design his event site
                        for <a href="http://patternsday.com/">Patterns Day</a>.</li>
                    <li>I saw some 'page painting' in chrome developer tools showing after a discussion on 'janky' sites. Jeremy
                        told me he had to remove an image from his event site after he found it to be create this unwanted
                        phenomenon.
                    </li>
                    <li>I was introduced to <a href="https://css-tricks.com/examples/ShapesOfCSS/">CSS shapes</a> and the browsers
                        that currently <a href="https://caniuse.com/#search=css%20shapes">support them</a>.</li>

                </ul>

                An intense but fantastic day - I'd like to thank Jeremy once again for his time and great advice :)
