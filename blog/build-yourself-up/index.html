            <p>What I've written here is meant for developers but I think it could work for anyone :)</p>
            <p> I feel like this post could be part of a series all about my experiences as a new developer that I've written
                about over the past year. It's been great having the chance to experience becoming a developer and share
                my thoughts along the way.</p>
            <p>My idea for this post built up over a few months of working on a complex project at my new job. I was completely
                new to some of the technologies (React, Redux, GraphQL). At the start, I didn't use these, but rather took
                on smaller stories/tasks and tried to prepare for taking more complex ones.</p>
            <p>A few months in, the larger stories began to grow in number and I tentatively took some on. At first, nobody
                expected me to go too fast and I asked a lot of questions. Eventually, I began to complete stories faster
                and with less help. While it was challenging and fun, there were times when I got stuck, felt frustrated
                and guilty about the time I took. Other negative things I felt included wondering whether I'd ever get better
                or ever learn how to do these things at all. In general, I was quite quick to put myself down when I didn't
                do something right the first time.
            </p>
            <p>It struck me this week that I often <em>put myself down</em> for doing things wrong, but hardly ever <em>build myself up</em>                when I do things right. I wondered why people tend to do this, and was reminded of something I learned studying
                child psychology.</p>
            <p>Despite people having different ideas of what is right and wrong, it's usually clear whether something is one
                or the other. For children, this might be using a fork to eat their dinner vs. repeatedly chucking the fork
                as far as they can across the dining room. It somehow seems easier to react to the fork chucking rather than
                sitting and eating quietly. This means the child gets more attention for misbehaving than behaving well.
                In psychology, this is called giving positive reinforcement (attention) for 'wrong' behaviour, and no reinforcement
                for 'right' behaviour. This can lead to an escalation of negative behaviour and frustration for both the
                child and caregiver.
            </p>

            <p>I think a few developers may do this to themselves - i.e. pay a lot of attention to their perceived failures
                and not enough to their victories. I've definitely done this a lot since becoming a developer. It might be
                because a lot more time and emotion is involved when something isn't going right. In contrast, when completing
                a task quickly and efficiently, it might seem less significant, and less energy might be put into celebrating.
                This is something I'm going to try and change. I think everyone needs positivity and reassurance when they
                are doing things right. Just as much from themselves as everyone else.</p>
            <p>Being a developer can be really hard and feelings of frustration can be common. I'd love to hear ideas on ways
                to pay less attention to the frustrating moments, and celebrate the positive ones more. If you have any ideas,
                let me know :)
