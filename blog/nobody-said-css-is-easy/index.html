            <p>Wait, some people have said this. But I'd like to politely voice the opinion that they are wrong.</p>
            <p>For almost two months, I have been working on a complex React project involving a complex SCSS implementation.
                I am new to such complex projects, and so have only just begun to really learn about what SCSS can do. And...
                there is a _lot_ to learn. But, it is a beautiful mess ❤️</p>
            <p>Before diving into the project two months ago, I refreshed my awareness of <a href="https://sass-lang.com/guide">Sass basics</a>.
                Then, I opened the project code in my text editor, and jumped in. I was dazzled by the lines and lines of
                multi-coloured code, immediately puzzled when I saw countless @ $ _ and, something I hadn't expected - functions.
                Up until now, I hadn't written much of my own SCSS, and to be honest, I still haven't. However, I am proud
                that I wrote a fully-functioning each loop in SCSS last week :)</p>
            <p>I was actually inspired to write this article after another fairly long struggle trying to style a component.
                I had to add a focus state to a custom checkbox. This seemingly simple task led me down a few rabbit holes.
                I learned a lot about the difficulties of styling a custom checkbox (i.e. one that is not browser-implemented).</p>

            <figure class="figure__border">
                <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Forms/The_native_form_widgets"><img src="img/browser-checkbox.png" alt="Browser-implemented checkbox styles"></a>
                <figcaption>^ Browser-implemented checkbox styles</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <figure class="figure__border">
                <a href="http://wtfforms.com/"><img src="img/custom-checkbox.png" alt="Custom checkbox style"></a>
                <figcaption>^ The custom checkbox style I wanted</figcaption>
            </figure>

            <p>After reading a few articles and finding lots of similar but differing opinions, I asked another developer,
                <a href="http://nevanscott.com/">Nevan</a>, to come and help me. </p>
            <pre><code>
.cp-#{$type}__input:focus {
    <strong>~</strong> .cp-#{$type}__dummy {
        border-color: cp-get-color-action(cta);
    }

    <strong>~</strong> .cp-#{$type}__label {
        font-weight: 700;
    }
}
</code></pre>

            <p>Above is code from the project. I knew I had to work on this specific piece of code in order to get a focus state
                on the checkboxes. See the little tildes (<strong>~</strong>)? Nevan pointed out to me that these can be
                used as a special CSS selector, making the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/General_sibling_selectors">general sibling combinator</a>                possible.</p>
            <img src="img/csslesson.jpg" alt="CSS lesson from a developer at my workplace">
            <p>We talked through different CSS selectors and Nevan drew some out for me. Once I'd learned what the general sibling
                combinator does, I was able to write the below code, which gave me a nice focus state for my checkbox:</p>
            <pre><code>
    .cp-#{$type}__input:checked:focus {
        ~ .cp-#{$type}__dummy {
            box-shadow: 0 0 0 0.075rem cp-get-color(base), 0 0 0 0.2rem cp-get-color-action(cta);
        }  
</pre>
            </code>

            <p>I have come to realise that a lovely side-effect of working on a large project & using SCSS has been an increasing
                awareness of how & where to implement accessibility. I will write about this in another blog post. One thing
                I gained a stronger awareness of (simply from working with checkboxes) is that it's important to progressively
                enhance UI components, so that a fancy custom one is able to fall back to the default browser styles and
                functionality. This way, a user can still access the UI if JavaScript or CSS fail.</p>
            <p>In conclusion to my first two months on a big project, I now know that getting confused, spending a long time
                studying many different files & folders, and asking other developers for help is a right of passage to becoming
                a better developer. I completed <a href="https://flukeout.github.io/">CSS Diner</a> a long time ago. However,
                nothing increases your learning power more than working on something big, real, confusing and frustrating
                ;)
            </p>
