            <p>I loved writing <a href="../words">100 words for 100 days</a> &amp; now want to write 100 days of little HTML,
                CSS or JS (ES6) lessons. I'm going to write about methods and techniques that I use often, either at work
                or on personal projects. The lessons will be written from a <strong>NEWBIE</strong> (i.e. my) perspective,
                and so may not be perfect, but they will offer a valuable insight into the thoughts of a new developer. My
                goal is to learn/document things for myself, and to show people, particularly other new developers, how someone
                like me approaches my work and hopefully give them something they can relate to :) Thanks to <a href="https://lottejackson.com">Charlotte</a>                for the suggestion!</p>

                <p>I keep getting tripped up at work by forgetting to write modular CSS classes. There are so many benefits
                    to a robust CSS architecture that I really want to get it right. BEM is a methodology to achieve this.
                    <code>Block</code>, <code>Element</code> and <code>Modifier</code>. A <code>Block</code> is a component
                    or feature than can stand alone and is not dependent on any other code. It can be re-used anywhere. Next,
                    an <code>Element</code>. This is always part of a <code>Block</code> and has no meaning on its own. Lastly,
                    there is the <code>Modifier</code>. This changes the behaviour and/or appearance of a <code>Block</code>                    or <code>Element</code>.</p>
                <p>Example:</p>
                <p><code>.button</code> is a block.</p>
                <p><code>.button__label</code> is an element.</p>
                <p><code>.button--confirm</code> is a modifier.</p>
                <p>See resources <a href="http://getbem.com/introduction/">here</a> and <a href="https://zellwk.com/blog/css-architecture-1/">here</a>.</p>

                        <img class="button__top-of-page" src="img/back-to-top.svg" alt="Back to top toggle">
                    </a></h2>
                <p>Also known as a fat arrow, <code>=></code>. This ES6 feature is a fat topic, so I'll concentrate on one aspect
                    today.
                </p>

                <pre><code>var elements = [
'Hydrogen',
'Helium',
'Lithium',
'Beryllium'
];
(elements.map(function(element) {return element.length}))
(elements.map(element => {return element.length}))
(elements.map(element => element.length))
(elements.map(({length}) => length))</code></pre>
                <p>Above is an altered version of the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/Arrow_functions">MDN</a>                    JavaScript Demo, where you will find a wealth of information on what fat arrows can do for you. The first
                    function in the list is written without fat arrows. The last three functions are variations of the first
                    function, showing how fat arrows can be used to write shorter function expressions, and therefore less
                    code. You will need a code compiler like <a href="https://babeljs.io/">Babel</a> to compile fat arrows
                    into ES5 syntax so older browsers can use your JavaScript.</p>
                <p>There are a _lot_ of resources that try explaining this syntax. Try Wes Bos's <a href="https://wesbos.com/arrow-functions/">introduction</a>                    for a start. This is complicated subject matter, though, so I suggest searching around for different
                    posts, reading a few and finding ones that make most sense to you.</p>

                    <p>I only just found out that <code>::before</code> (<code>:before</code>) and <code>::after</code> (<code>:after</code>)
                        are psuedo elements, which are different from psuedo classes. Both of these are grouped under psuedo
                        selectors. I like this quote from MDN ~
                        <blockquote>Even the most skilled web developers are still amazed by what's possible using selectors.</blockquote>
                    </p>
                    <p>Psuedo selectors are only two types of selectors. The others are: simple selectors, attribute selectors,
                        multiple selectors and combinators. All of these help us to target and style HTML elements.</p>
                    <p>So, psuedo selectors include both psuedo elements and psuedo classes. They are added to the end of other
                        selectors, and don't apply to whole elements, only parts of them.</p>
                    <p>The psuedo classes (e.g. <code>:hover</code>, <code>:focus</code>, and <code>:nth-of-type()</code> -
                        plus 38 others) style elements in a <em>certain state</em>.</p>
                    <p>The psuedo elements (e.g. <code>::after</code>, <code>::before</code>, and <code>::first-letter</code>                        - plus 3 others, not including experimental ones) apparently need <code>::</code> rather than <code>:</code>,
                        although I've used them with only one. These don't depend on the state of an element.</p>
                    <p>See this <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/Introduction_to_CSS/Pseudo-classes_and_pseudo-elements">MDN</a>                        page for great examples and to use their awesome active learning playground (I did and it was great
                        for learning)!</p>

                    <p>The <code>this</code> keyword is found in various programming languages, and behaves a certain way in

                        <a href="https://codepen.io/ambrwlsn90/pen/ELEmxw?editors=1111">codepen</a> for the code. It showcases
                        one of the six ways <code>this</code> is used in JavaScript - thanks to what I learned from Zell
                        Liew's great <a href="https://zellwk.com/blog/this/">blog post</a>. I really recommend this post
                        for beginners - you can try the examples in your console! In short, <code>this</code> can be used
                        globally, in object constructions, object methods, simple functions, arrow functions, and event listeners.

                    <p>Recently, I began to write React at work and I've been doing okay with presentational components, but
                        much less so with business logic (I hear ya <a href="http://bradfrost.com/blog/post/my-struggle-to-learn-react/">Brad Frost</a>).
                        I've heard that improving my ES6 will really help, so you'll see more little lessons on it, but I
                        also want to touch on how to manage dynamic state. Despite the popularity of Redux, one of my developer
                        friends recommended covering Flux.</p>
                    <p>Flux is an application architecture for React (that can also be used elsewhere) utilizing a unidirectional
                        data flow. In essence, it is an observer pattern that offers one-way data binding. Very useful when
                        you need to keep lots of components in sync.</p>
                    <p><strong>action -> dispatcher -> store -> view</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The <strong>action</strong> creator formats messages (what the user does) from the UI</li>
                        <li>The <strong>dispatcher</strong> takes the formatted messages and synchronously sends them to different
                            stores
                        </li>
                        <li>The <strong>store</strong> holds all state logic and changes it by deciding what actions it wants
                            to pay attention to</li>
                        <li>The <strong>view</strong> takes changes from the store and updates the UI</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Please look at Lin Clark's great <a href="https://code-cartoons.com/a-cartoon-guide-to-flux-6157355ab207">cartoon guide</a>                        for more details. For a more code-heavy example, see <a href="https://blog.andrewray.me/flux-for-stupid-people/">here</a>.
                        I feel like the best way to learn about Flux is to build things in tandem with reading about it (and

                    <p>JSON, or JavaScript Object Notation, is a simple language that represents objects on the Web and facilitates
                        data exchange. LD, or Linked Data, allows for the expression of critical data on a site, and for
                        it to be shared across sites. I first heard of it at
                        <a href="https://beyondtellerrand.com/events/duesseldorf-2018/speakers">Beyond Tellerrand</a> in
                        Düsseldorf on May 7th, during a talk about web annotations by <a href="https://lyza.com">Lyza Danger Gardner</a>.
                        JSON-LD allows expressions of linked data in JavaScript. It's like grammar for describing strutured
                        data. It can be thought of as JSON, but with added semantics. And it can be easily implemented into
                        existing JSON structures. Here's some example JSON:</p>
                    <pre><code>{
    "name": "Amber Wilson",
    "homepage": "https://amberwilson.co.uk",
    "picture": "https://twitter.com/account/profil_image/ambrwlsn90"
}
</code></pre> Here is similar information in JSON-LD format:
                    <pre>
<code>{
    "@context": {
        "xsd": "http://www.w3c.org/2001/XMLSchema#",
        "foaf": "http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/",
    },
    "@id": "http://me.amberwilson.co.uk",
    "@type": "foaf:Person",
    "foaf:name": "Amber Wilson",
}
</code></pre>
                    <p>Above, we see that <code>context</code> can be added to data. <code>foaf</code> stands for "friend of
                        a friend" (see <a href="http://www.foaf-project.org/">here</a>), which deals with people-related
                        terms. <code>id</code> and <code>type</code>, like <code>context</code>, assist in making our data
                        shareable and semantic.</p>
                    <p>The concept of JSON-LD is simple, but using it can take getting used to. For more in-depth information,
                        see <a href="https://json-ld.org/primer/latest/">here</a>. </p>

                    <h2 class="m-t-m">Day 7 - CSS Layout<a href="#csslayout"> #</a>
                        <a class="link__top-of-page" href="#">
                            <img class="button__top-of-page" src="img/back-to-top.svg" alt="Back to top toggle">
                        </a></h2>
                    <p>CSS layout is something that amazes and confuses me at the same time. There seem to be so many approaches
                        (e.g. floats, flexbox, grid), and so many frameworks (way too many to mention). The paradox of choice
                        seems to apply here.</p>

                    <p>I love hearing from people about CSS layout, and I was lucky to hear <a href="http://www.miriamsuzanne.com/">Miriam Suzanne</a>                        talk about it at <a href="https://beyondtellerrand.com/events/duesseldorf-2018/speakers">Beyond Tellerrand</a>                        (check out the awesome layout on her site). The message she gave was to use CSS grid, and provide
                        fallbacks for browsers that aren't grid-compatible. She reasons that as grid makes layouts so easy
                        (and naturally responsive), that there is time to re-create fallback layouts, which allows more creative
                        control.
                    </p>
                    <blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en">
                        <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Often I allow fallback layouts to be much simpler. CSS Grid has power to create layouts that have
                            no *exact* fallback. Since grid makes many layouts easier, I have extra time to do both. Similar
                            time spent, more creative control.<br><br>Your mileage will depend on your constraints.</p>&mdash;
                        Miriam Suzanne (@mirisuzanne) <a href="https://twitter.com/mirisuzanne/status/993813309441880064?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 8, 2018</a></blockquote>

                    </p>
                    <p>One thing I really like about CSS layouts is that they aren't designed to be used in isolation. On the
                        contrary, you can mix and match them. A grid item can become a flex container, and a flex item can
                        become a grid. You can even use floats with flexbox and grid.</p>

                    <p>I am half-way through Wes Bos's <a href="https://cssgrid.io/">CSS grid</a> course and already have ideas
                        I am excited to make come to life using grid. There are looots of great posts and articles out there
                        by people who have had tonnes of fun and learned loads by using grid. I really recommend finding
                        some and making some stuff!</p>

                    <h2 class="m-t-m">Day 8 - Debugging<a href="#debugging"> #</a>
                        <a class="link__top-of-page" href="#">
                            <img class="button__top-of-page" src="img/back-to-top.svg" alt="Back to top toggle">
                        </a></h2>
                    <p>Recently at work, I've watched other developers use <code>console.log</code> a lot in code to find desired
                        values given by certain functions. I am often still confused where to put <code>console.log</code>,
                        and it is definitely not the only way to debug, so I've also begun to use the developer tools JavaScript
                        debugger in Firefox and Chrome. These tools allow you to pause the execution of your code, and walk
                        through it to help you find bugs.</p>
                    <p>The debugger can do a lot, and it'd take a much longer post to walk through this tool's UI, so I'll mention
                        four of the most commonly used debugging methods here.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Step over code</strong></li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Steps over a function that doesn't contain a bug and runs its code</li>
                        </ul>
                        <li><strong>Step into code</strong></li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Steps inside a function and allows you to run each part separately</li>
                        </ul>
                        <li><strong>Step out of code</strong></li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Steps out of a function you are inside, and runs its code</li>
                        </ul>
                        <li><strong>Resume execution of code</strong></li>
                        <ul>Runs all code up until a specified breakpoint, which can be set at any point</ul>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Debugging is something developers have to be really good at. So don't be scared to do it! Or, be scared
                        but do it anyway, you'll get better :)</p>
                    <p>Check out the docs on the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Tools/Debugger">Firefox</a>                        debugger and the <a href="https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/javascript/reference#breakpoints">Chrome</a>                        debugger. Lots of great info there to help you get started. Also check out <a href="https://peterlyons.com/js-debug">this article</a>                        from Peter Lyons. He explains debugging of both front-end and back-end JavaScript code.</p>

                    <h2 class="m-t-m">Day 9 - Readable Code<a href="#readable-code"> #</a>
                        <a class="link__top-of-page" href="#">
                        <img class="button__top-of-page" src="img/back-to-top.svg" alt="Back to top toggle">
                    </a></h2>
                    <p>There are so many books, articles, and videos about how to make code readable, so I'll keep this short
                        and from my perspective (as a new developer who works mainly with JavaScript).</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Code style</strong> of your project. This is specific to each project and covers things like
                            indentation, levels of nesting, naming, spacing etc. There are some nice tools to help with this
                            - for example <em>ESLint</em> that you can configure to autoformat your code to your specified
                            style upon file save.</li>
                        <li><strong>Structure</strong>. This is about how you organise your code and files in a project. I have
                            been taught the benefit of abstracting and modularising code, making it easier to tell what each
                            part does and easier to test. In React, I've been writing components that are either presentational
                            (how things look) or containers (how things work). Between different projects and programming
                            languages, there are many, many ways to structure code well, and opinions tend to differ.</li>
                        <li><strong>Commenting</strong>. There are three ways I've been doing this - either in my CSS, or in
                            one of two ways (single-line with <code>//</code> or the <a href="http://usejsdoc.org/index.html">JSDoc</a>                            way) in my JS. The most important way to comment CSS is when <em>magic numbers</em>, i.e. seemingly
                            random numbers that don't use pre-defined mixins or seem to relate to the rest of the code, are
                            present. Leaving a note about these numbers can help other developers (or yourself a few months
                            later) understand why the CSS is written that way. An important thing to remember when commenting
                            JS code is that comments should state what the expected results of the code (e.g. a function)
                            is, and not a description of what the code is doing.</li>
                        <li><strong>Naming</strong>. This is well-known as one of the hardest things in programming. But it pays
                            off big time. It helps developers get as close a possible to the coveted <em>self-documenting code</em>                            that doesn't need any comments (although I think no comments at all is probably a bad thing).
                            I feel some developers keep function and variable names short in order to make their code look
                            cleaner and keep file sizes small. However, on my latest project at work, without some of the
                            really long and descriptive naming going on, I'd have a much harder time understanding the complex
                            codebase.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    These are the four areas around readable code that popped into my mind. There are definitely more, and there are <em>so</em>                    many resources on this. Go check 'em out, and dicsuss them with people! I know I'll continue to do both
                    those things for a long time to come.

                    <ul>
                        <li>A sequence containing some letters, numbers or symbols.</li>
                        <li>Have available methods and properties.</li>
                        <li>Can be stored in variables.</li>
                        <li>Sit between either single quotes (<code>' '</code>), double quotes (<code>" "</code>), or backticks
                            (
                            <code>` `</code>).</li>
                        <li>Can be concatenated (stuck together) with the <code>+</code> operator, or with backticks (template
                            strings) in ES6.</li>
                        <li>Template strings, or template literals, can take any valid JavaScript expression, allowing dynamic
                            strings.
                        </li>
                        <li>Can contain special characters, such as quotation marks, as long as they are escaped - e.g. <code>"She'\ll be coming '\round the mountain when she comes"</code>.</li>
                        <li>There's no need to escape dissimilar quote marks. For example: "This 'is' fine". This is probably
                            why we tend to favour double quotes in HTML attribute values, and singles in JS (since it allows
                            you to create some innerHTML without the need for escaping).</li>
                        <li>When using template literals, you don't need to escape <code>'</code> or <code>"</code> ... and <code>`this</code>                            <code>"is"</code> <code>'also'</code> <code>fine`</code></li>
                        <li>Is either a <em>string primitive</em> - immutable and more common, e.g. <code>const stringPrimitive = "Hello, I am a string.";</code>                            .</li>
                        <li>Or a <em>string object</em> - <code>const stringObject = new String("Hello, I am a string.");</code></li>
                        <li>The <code>typeof</code> operator is used to determine if a string's type is <em>string</em> or <em>object</em>.</li>
                        <li>Each character is indexed and can be accessed by an index number using square bracket notation (e.g.
                            "Hello World" - <code>myString[0]</code> outputs "H").</li>
                        <li>Similar methods to the one above include: <code>charAt()</code>, <code>indexOf()</code>, <code>lastIndexOf()</code>,
                            <code>slice()</code>.</li>
                        <li>Other common methods and properties are: <code>length</code>, <code>toUpperCase()</code>, <code>toLowerCase()</code>,
                            <code>split()</code>, <code>trim()</code>, <code>replace()</code>.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>This list is meant as a quick and basic introduction to the magical world of JavaScript strings. If there's

                    <p>Emmet provides a really useful way to make developing easier. It improves the <strong>developer experience</strong>&#x2122;.
                        I only discovered it recently but love it already. It originated as <a href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2009/11/zen-coding-a-new-way-to-write-html-code/">Zen Coding</a>                        about ten years ago. There are a few uses (see official <a href="https://docs.emmet.io/">docs</a>),
                        but I'll focus on the amazing <em>abbreviation and snippet expansion</em> feature.</p>
                    <p>In your HTML, say you need 100 divs. And each should have a class of teddybear. Typing these out by hand
                        might be boring. With Emmet, you can write <code>div*100.teddybear</code> (then press 'tab'). Or
                        if you need each class to be item1, item2, etc. then you can write <code>div.item$*3</code>. There
                        are also HTML elements that get handily created with relevent attributes - try typing <code>a</code>                        or <code>img</code>. See one of the original articles on Emmet <a href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2009/11/zen-coding-a-new-way-to-write-html-code/">here</a>                        for more examples. You can download it or check if it comes built-in with your text editor of choice
                        - I use VSCode and found Emmet was ready for use!</p>
                    <p>Emmet also features CSS selector expansion which allows you to type abbreviated selectors that are expanded
                        when you press 'tab'. It can also automatically add vendor prefixes for you. Try and see how many
                        abbreviations you can guess <a href="https://docs.emmet.io/css-abbreviations/fuzzy-search/">here</a>                        ;)</p>

                    <p>Today at work, we talked about test automation. One of the developers mentioned this quote:</p>

                    <blockquote>We cannot rely on mass inspection to improve quality, though there are times when 100 percent inspection
                        is necessary. As Harold S. Dodge said many years ago, ‘You cannot inspect quality into a product.’
                        The quality is there or it isn’t by the time it’s inspected. - William E. Deming in <em>Out of the Crisis</em></blockquote>

                    <p>Therefore we cannot rely on creating features in a hurry, throwing them over the fence and then expecting
                        our applications to work well and without bugs. To instil quality from the start of a feature, there
                        should be tests for it.</p>

                    <p>Automated testing helps with this. Pre-commit hooks can be used when deploying builds so that errors
                        are caught and addressed early. Unit tests can be run using pre-commit hooks - see my post on unit
                        tests <a href="https://amberwilson.co.uk/blog/unit-tests/">here</a>. However, there is a fine line
                        between having too many automated tests, e.g. end-to-end tests that take too long to run with each
                        build, and not having enough. Some companies run quicker unit tests on each build, and then run end-to-end
                        tests as a nightly build.</p>
                    <p>Please see the image below for one of many examples of the testing pyramid if you are confused when I
                        mention unit tests or end-to-end (UI) tests:</p>

                    <p>Manual testing is important too. It is usually done by QA engineers, and helps reveal edge cases that
                        automated tests do not catch. As one developer at my work said, these tests are like the cherry on
                        top of the testing pyramid.</p>

                        <img class="button__top-of-page" src="img/back-to-top.svg" alt="Back to top toggle">
                    </a></h2>
                    <p>I didn't learn about these at work but rather from a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1DMolJ2FrNY">video</a>                        on the JavaScript reduce function by the wonderful <a href="https://twitter.com/mpjme">MPJ</a>.</p>
                    <p>Object literals are a data structure that can be used in JavaScript. I really like seeing how data can
                        be organised and object literals do this really nice and tidily. Here's an example:</p>
                    <pre><code>var cat = {
    myCat: 'Tabby',
    getCat: catTypes('Siamese')
}
</code></pre>
                    <p>The above code is an alteration of the MDN <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/bm/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Grammar_and_types#Object_literals">example</a>.
                        I found MDN's explanation of object literals a little mechanical (compared to other resources I found),
                        but it does give quite a clear portrayal of how flexible object literals can be. For instance, the
                        typical combination of a key (<code>myCat</code>), value (<code>Tabby</code>) pair can be accessed
                        and used in other places in your code, without these values polluting the global scope*. You can
                        use the <code>catTypes</code> function like so:</p>
                    <code><pre>function catTypes(type) {
    if (type !== 'Siamese') {
        return type;
    } else {
        return "Many " + type + " cats have blue eyes.";
    }
}

console.log(cat.getCat) // Siamese
</code></pre>
                    <p>If this was not exciting enough, there are many other data types (not only functions) that can be organised
                        using object literals - e.g. array literals (see an example of this in MPJ's video), nested object
                        literals, numbers, any string, etc.</p>
                    <p>My friend <a href="https://qubyte.codes/">Mark</a> also informed me that an object can contain itself
                        (which is not recommend because it breaks JSON.stringify)!</p>
                    <p>Of course as with any programming language, there are rules. Some of these are that a colon separates
                        the key from the value, a comma separates key-value pairs, there shouldn't be a comma after the last
                        value-pair (well, it's fine to have a dangling comma, but many style guides don't want you to do
                        it), etc.</p>
                    <p>For more rules and when to use, check out <a href="http://www.dyn-web.com/tutorials/object-literal/#f2">this </a>                        nice post, and the MDN page.</p>
                    <p>I haven't had much of a chance to use object literals in the wild yet, but I hope to soon. After I have,
                        I hope to write an updated post that describes my new insights.</p>
                    <p>* An object (literal) can be used like a namespace to avoid polluting the global object, but there's
                        still the reference of the object attached to global. If you want to completely eliminate variables
                        polluting the global object as fields, then IIFEs are for you. Some modules are also isolated from
                        global. So, object literals limit pollution through namespacing, but do not entirely eliminate it.
                        (Thanks, <a href="https://qubyte.codes/">Mark</a>, for the information).</p>

                    <h2 class="m-t-m">Day 14 - Ternary Operator<a href="#ternaryoperator"> #</a>
                        <a class="link__top-of-page" href="#">
                        <img class="button__top-of-page" src="img/back-to-top.svg" alt="Back to top toggle">
                    </a></h2>

                    <p>This is one of my favourite things in JavaScript. Not only is it simple and easy to use but it's also
                        applicable to lots of situations <strong>and</strong> it can replace more verbose syntax (like <code>if</code>                        statements). It looks something like this:</p>
                    <pre><code>const hoursOfSleep = 5;
const timeForSleep = (hoursOfSleep < 8) <strong>?</strong> 
    "Yup, no more phone for you" <strong>:</strong> 
    "Ah nah, a few more minutes of phone time won't hurt"; 
</code></pre>
                    <p>Notice the <strong>?</strong> and the <strong>:</strong></p>
                    <p>These are the important parts.</p>
                    <p>If the condition (in this case <code>hoursOfSleep</code>) in front of the question mark evaluates to
                        true, the value of the first expression before the colon is returned. If the condition in front of
                        the question mark evaluates to false, the value of the second expression after the colon is returned.
                        As you can see, if you have had less than 8 hours of sleep, you shouldn't be using your phone.</p>
                    <p>Ternary operators are really flexible and can be used in a number of ways. You can stack them together:</p>
                    <pre><code>const catsRule = true,
const dogsDrool = false,
const catDog = catsRule ? 
    (dogsDrool ? "Let's all live in harmony": "Both cats and dogs drool") :
    (dogsDrool ? "Dogs are cool, nearly as cool as cats" : "Dogs and cats can be friends");
    </code></pre>
                    <p>This outputs <code>"Both cats and dogs drool"</code>, and it's also total nonsense but I hope you had
                        fun staring at it and trying to figure it out. You don't even need to use the parentheses, and can
                        also use multiple statements separated by commas. You can return statements in functions. You can
                        use them in place of bulky <code>if/else</code> statements with much nicer-to-read code. The question
                        mark means <code>if</code> and the colon means <code>else</code>.</p>
                    <p>I use ternary operators at work all the time. I hope you enjoy them as much as I do. Check out the
                        <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Conditional_Operator">MDN</a>                        page for some examples. This <a href="https://scotch.io/tutorials/understand-the-javascript-ternary-operator-like-abc">post</a>                        is lovely too.</p>
