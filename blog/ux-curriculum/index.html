            <p>(Inspired by David Venturi's <a href="https://medium.com/@davidventuri/i-dropped-out-of-school-to-create-my-own-data-science-master-s-here-s-my-curriculum-1b400dcee412">writing</a>,
                this article includes a bit about me, something about fun, and my UX curriculum. Being new to User Experience
                Design, I found this to be a really useful thought exercise and I hope you do too.)</p>

            <p>Have you pursued higher education or years of work experience in a field unrelated to design? Live in a city
                but don’t have the money or time to pursue a User Experience or Human-Computer Interaction degree?</p>

            <p>If so, we have something in common.</p>

            <p>It is possible to take what you already know and apply it to a career in UX design. Passion, self-learning and
                reaching out to others in the industry will help get you there.</p>

            <p>I’ve met people from a huge number of backgrounds ranging from marine biologist to maths teacher to anthropologist
                to marketer who have all been successful switching their career to digital. They have all been more than
                happy to talk to me about their experiences and help guide me to form my own.</p>

            <p>Why do I like User Experience Design?</p>

            <ol>
                <li>I’ve always had a spark of creativity inside me, finding my happy place in hobbies of drawing, designing
                    and photography.</li>
                <li>I have a background in psychology and completed a Master's in Child and Adolescent Psychology <a href="http://en.mastersinleiden.nl/programmes/child-and-adolescent-psychology/en/introduction">here</a>.</li>
                <li>The UX industry is dynamic, encourages life-long learning and is <em>fun</em>.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>“<strong>You can’t be creative if you’re not having fun</strong>” - Dave Kelly of IDEO</p>

            <p>This phrase speaks to me on many levels. It reminds me of the magic of childhood where play is encouraged and
                creativity is always rewarded. Adults glean delight from witnessing children having fun, and will always
                seek opportunities for them to have it.</p>
            <p> Why then is fun encouraged so much less in adulthood? A culturally-defined cut-off age, for example 18, signifies
                a sharp boundary between childhood and adulthood. Between playful learning and serious responsibilities.
                There <em>are</em> responsibilities to be serious about but, as is more often the case these days, young
                adults tend to get bogged down and feel hopeless when it comes to fulfilling them. </p>
            <p>Imagine if it was a top priority of employers to make workspaces as fun as possible, help employees feel good,
                and inspire creativity. Maybe this isn’t feasible in every workplace, but it seems to be readily encouraged
                and available in the creative industry. I want to experience for the first time what it is like to be part
                of such a fun and nurturing environment, while getting to indulge my hobbies every day.</p>

            <p>I’ve had a go at creating my own UX curriculum based on my psychology Master’s programme. This exercise has helped
                me uncover important aspects of UX that were not apparent at first. I wrote it based on what I've learned
                in the past nine months (from knowing nothing about the industry to getting an internship). I'd like it to
                show UX from a different perspective and help inspire people to learn more. These articles really helped
                me get started - '<a href="https://uxplanet.org/inclusive-ux-education-designing-a-free-online-learning-curriculum-52154a188af3">Designing a free online learning curriculum</a>'

                thought :)</p>
