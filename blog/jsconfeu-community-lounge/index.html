        <time datetime="2018-06-07" class="dt-published">7th June 2018</time>
        <div class="e-content">

            <p>One month ago, I was invited by <a href="https://twitter.com/vanessayuenn">Vanessa</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/sheley">Michele</a>                to speak at the JSConf EU community lounge in sunny Berlin. This was a tremendous honour - not only would
                I be able to talk about how great <a href="https://codebar.io">codebar</a> is to a crowd of eager attendees,
                but I'd be able to participate in both <a href="https://2018.cssconf.eu/">CSS</a> and <a href="https://2018.jsconf.eu/"> JSConf EU</a>,
                and catch up with lots of old and new friends.</p>
            <p>Something I couldn't help noticing as soon as I arrived, was the fantastic effort the conference organisers put
                into designing a great space for everyone.</p>
            <img src="img/arena-berlin.jpg" alt="Arena Berlin during CSS and JSConf EU">
            <p>One of the best corners of this space was definitely the community lounge!</p>
            <p>On arrival, I found the lounge prepped and pillowed-up, the sticker table and job board ready to be filled, and
                plenty of space available for people to watch lightning talks from local tech initiatives. The thing I was
                most excited about, though, was to see the codebar poster sitting proudly right at the entrance.</p>
            <img src="img/codebar-and-me.jpg" alt="Amber holding the codebar poster">
            <p>Across three days, there were so many great speakers who shared their local initiatives - ones that had made
                such a difference in their own lives. Among them were several Berlin meet ups I had long admired and attended.
                Wanting to give codebar every ounce of credit it deserves, I created the best presentation I could. I wanted
                to talk about how codebar works, and let people know how to get involved in <a href="https://codebar.io/berlin">codebar Berlin</a>.
                I also wanted to get across to the audience how much codebar means to me personally.</p>
            <p>It was mid-2016 when I attended my first codebar in <a href="https://codebar.io/brighton">Brighton</a>, UK - and
                without exaggerating, I can confidently say that it amazed me beyond words. I remember thinking "how can
                it possibly be that I'm here, being introduced to codebar by fantastic organisers, inside a lovely venue,
                with free food?" Not only that - how was it that I got to sit with a super nice coach for TWO hours to refresh
                my rusty HTML and CSS? Since being supported through codebar to achieve my first internship in tech, and
                becoming a coach and organiser myself around a year ago, multiple students have approached me with exactly
                the same questions.</p><img src="img/codebar-lightning-talk.jpg" alt="Amber speaking about codebar">
            <p>One of the best things about the whole experience of the community lounge for me was hearing from people who
                feel equally as strongly about the initiatives they are part of, and who have achieved similarly wonderful
                things - all through the tireless efforts of volunteers who make such things possible.</p>

            <p>I want to sincerely thank the organisers of CSSConf EU and JSConf EU for being so kind to invite codebar, and
                all of the other great initiatives that provide safe spaces for people to learn. I want to give a special
                shout out to <a href="https://twitter.com/janl">Jan</a> who was an amazing host. It was an incredible opportunity
                to spread information about the great things codebar makes possible. I am really, really excited to report
                that on the Monday after the conferences, we had the <a href="https://twitter.com/codebarBerlin/status/1003900234613907456">busiest Berlin codebar</a>                on record - and I can't wait to see what else we can do to help even more students learn and discover possibilities
                for themselves in tech.</p>
            <p>If you'd like to get more involved in codebar - we are always looking for more students, <a href="https://codebar.io/coaches">coaches</a>                and <a href="https://codebar.io/sponsors">sponsors</a>! - please see (and sign up on) our <a href="https://codebar.io">website</a>,
