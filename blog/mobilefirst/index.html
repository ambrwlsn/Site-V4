            <p>Today I realised I wasn't adhering to a new, up-and-coming idea called '<a href="https://www.lukew.com/ff/entry.asp?933">Mobile First</a>'...maybe
                you've heard of it?</p>
            <p>Once I had written a correct media query to adhere to this interesting new idea, I noticed my site looked pretty
                ugly.
            </p><img src="img/site-ugly.png" alt="ugly site">
            <p>But still good on all screens less than 520px.</p><img src="img/site-mobile.png" alt="mobile site">
            <p>It is supposed to look similar on desktop.</p><img src="img/site-pretty.png" alt="pretty site">
            <p>I effectively had to switch my mindset around. Instead of thinking of everything inside a media query as belonging
                to the mobile part of my design, I had to imagine it contained the desktop design. And the place where desktop
                code lived before now resides within a media query. The resulting switch didn't take long to accomplish and
                gave me another chance to look at my CSS, and to tidy it up a little - always a good practice now and again.</p>
            <p>In any case, I can now feel proud that my site adheres to the best practice of Mobile First design.</p>
