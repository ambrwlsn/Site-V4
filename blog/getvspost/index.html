            <p> Amidst a learning spree on semantic HTML and the ways servers communicate with web browsers, I was introduced
                to 'GET' and 'POST' requests. </p>

            <p>These are HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol - the language the browser uses to 'speak' with servers) request
                methods, typically used for sending and receiving data in forms. They are written like this inside the HTML5
                form element:</p>
            <p><img src="img/getpostmethods.jpg" alt="get and post methods"></p>

            <p>The semantics behind the form element could form (see what I did there?) another lesson entirely. They are explained
                nicely <a href="https://internetingishard.com/html-and-css/forms/">here</a>.</p>

            <p>GET and POST requests can be tricky to understand because some explanations are too techincal and miss the big
                picture. Here are some basics:
                <p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>GET requests are the default method used by browsers, meaning that if no method is specified, a GET
                            request will be issued automatically.</li>
                        <li>Both methods are able to send to and retrieve from data a server, however GET should only really
                            be used as a 'getter' for retrieving data, because using it to send data raises some privacy
                            issues.
                        </li>
                        <li>GET requests send information (name and value pairs in forms) within the URL of HTTP requests, rather
                            than in the body. This means information submitted in a form will be visible in the URL. For
                            example, when logging into a site, sensitive information such as a password would be part of
                            the URL.</li>
                        <li>In addition, a limited amount of data can be displayed in a URL. This means submitted data could
                            be lost.</li>
                        <li>POST requests send information in a separate header file. Data sent this way is also not encrypted,
                            but is safer.</li>

                    </ul>

                    <p>This <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9o_4lsOkQ3g&t=307s">video</a> gives a practical example
                        and describes further differences between GET and POST (skip to 5:19).</p>
