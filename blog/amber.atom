          It is T-minus 4 months and 3 days until I am due to give my first talk on web stuff at Material in Iceland. I decided to jump in the deep end with this one, but I'm relishing the challenge.

            If you have a sweet tooth like me you might imagine a round, freshly-baked treat containing chocolate chips. Conversely, internet cookies (a.k.a. HTTP cookies) contain data, usually in the form of a text file.

            Amidst a learning spree on semantic HTML and the ways servers communicate with web browsers, I was introduced to 'GET' and 'POST' requests.

            Today I spent a great day at Clearleft, soaking in the lovely atmosphere, chatting with the wonderful staff. I sat down in the morning to talk with Jeremy about the web and the internet, web apps and native apps. We chatted about tech company
            structures, job titles, career advice and much more.

            I was tasked by Jeremy to explore the differences between the Internet and The World Wide Web. At the start, I was hard pressed to explain them. All I knew is that the 'Web' was created by someone called Tim Berners-Lee. I thought this meant he'd
            invented the entire Internet. I soon realised how wrong I was.

            Let’s talk about podcasts. I have always liked the idea of them. Like audio books, you can take them anywhere and listen anytime. They enable you to access up-to-date, current opinions on just about any facet of life you can think of. If you’re
            wondering whether there is a podcast on a topic you’re interested in, I can bet you there is.

            It was around October last year when I arrived at 68 Middle Street for a codebar session. It was the first time I had been in the building and I was immediately struck by how spaceous and well-designed it was. Even if I wasn't entirely sure what
            people did there.
