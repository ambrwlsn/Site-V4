               Firstly, what is pair programming? It’s two developers sitting together, usually at one computer, where one types code and the other checks the code. In essence it involves two developers who are thinking about different aspects of the same programming feature, and are constantly communicating in order to keep their understanding in sync. Some of you may know this already. Apart from this very short introduction, I can really only tell you about my own personal experiences with it.

               Apart from code, what makes a good developer? After a brilliant meeting with Richard, the tech lead at
                    my company, where we discussed my progress as a developer and what I could start aiming for, I came away
                    with some (what I think are) really nice insights from our discussion. I want to share those here.

                This is a bit of a retrospective post, because the things I’m going to talk about happened on the last day of January. It was the day before my new job began, and I’d been in Berlin for 10 days. I had signed up to a codebar Berlin meetup about a week before, as a student, and was really excited to go along and see what codebar in Berlin was like. Before I moved to Berlin, I’d been part of codebar Brighton for about 1.5 years as a student, coach and organiser.

                Today I attended the Global Diversity CFP Day – Berlin style. There were 13 amazing mentors and over 20 students – all of us hosted by the awesome Stefan Judis and Irina Botea in the Contentful offices. The day was pre-planned for us by the great Peter Aitken. We watched inspiring educational videos, had discussions and completed exercises. The exercise which struck the biggest chord with the participants was the one on use of exclusionary language within public speaking, and how we can work to be much more inclusionary.

            Your productivity is all about you. I don’t ever like to advocate for lists like “10 ways to boost your productivity today”. Productivity is personal. Everyone’s ideas about it are different. We all seek a definition of it, and when we find one that sounds sensible, we put precious energy into achieving it. However, if it’s someone else’s definition, there’s not a huge chance we will achieve it and this can leave us feeling bad.

          There is a room that contains all there is to know about images. The door to it is locked. Most of us have casually peered through its keyhole or witnessed light of various colours and brightness spilling from it. If you are granted a guest pass to the room, beware. Akin to JK Rowling’s Triwizard Maze, you are likely to get lost in its twisting passages, or be usurped by something surprising along the way.

It’s 4–6 minutes long and designed to be all about the speaker  — it’s called The Icebreaker. Due to being busy with a conference speech, I was only able to speed-write this 2 days before giving it. Nevertheless, thanks to the brilliant people who'd helped me practice my larger speech, I delivered this one fantastically!

          I discover ideas every day by talking to people, listening to them, reading, writing, attending events, going to meetups, sharing ideas, pushing myself out of my comfort zone.

          Today I sat with Russell Ward, technical director at The Unit. We talked about how I can get involved in the development team as part of my internship. This quickly turned into a discussion about programming languages and the Web.

          Earlier this week I attended a public speaking workshop run by Matt Matheson. There were ten people in the group. We wrote stories. We played games. We presented. One hour in we had already talked in front of everyone four times. The lovely thing is – everyone did really well. We were all praised and given immediate feedback and I learned something new each time I spoke.

          URLs have stood the test of time on the Web, providing us from the very beginning with an unmanned gateway to information, ability to share things, and to search (where would we be today without our trusty search engines?)

            I was tasked by Jeremy to explore the differences between the Internet and The World Wide Web. At the start, I was hard pressed to explain them. All I knew is that the 'Web' was created by someone called Tim Berners-Lee. I thought this meant he'd
            invented the entire Internet. I soon realised how wrong I was.

            Let’s talk about podcasts. I have always liked the idea of them. Like audio books, you can take them anywhere and listen anytime. They enable you to access up-to-date, current opinions on just about any facet of life you can think of. If you’re
            wondering whether there is a podcast on a topic you’re interested in, I can bet you there is.

            It was around October last year when I arrived at 68 Middle Street for a codebar session. It was the first time I had been in the building and I was immediately struck by how spaceous and well-designed it was. Even if I wasn't entirely sure what people did there.
