			<p>I am starting this post almost 4 months too late, but I want it here so I can be kept (at least a little) accountable
				for starting (and finishing!) as many books as I can.</p>
			<p>Most of the books I read are recommended by friends. Any others will either be completely random or based on my interest
				in science, design, psychology or philisophy. Some will be about things that I really think I should know more about,
				like politics.</p>
			<p>Here are the books I have read so far:</p>
			<img src="img/shakespeare.jpg" alt="Front cover of Shakespeare by Bill Bryson" aria-describedby="p1">
			<p>Shakespeare - Bill Bryson</p>
			<p id="p1">A really cool insight into just how hard people have tried to gather reputable, solid evidence about Shakespeare's life
				and who he actually was. Throughout, it becomes ever clearer that the truth is likely forever lost. I loved the picture
				that's painted of Shakespearean London, and the antics of other prominent figures from the time period.</p>
			<img src="img/inhgyaihgywtb.jpg" alt="Front cover of it's not how good you are, it's how good you want to be by Paul Arden"
			    aria-describedby="p2">
			<p>It's Not How Good You Are, It's How Good You Want To Be - Paul Arden</p>
			<p id="p2">Rollercoaster of good ideas that were learned from a career in advertising. Stuffed full of tasty advice on how to be
				creatively brilliant. Insights into the minds of clients and what they really want. And that they don't want what you
				think they probably want. We may all hate adverts, but really we are all selling something. "We are all in advertising.
				It's a part of life."</p>
			<img src="img/allneonlikelove.jpg" alt="Front cover of All Neon Like Love by Dan Gennoe" aria-describedby="p3">
			<p>All Neon Like Love - Dan Gennoe</p>
			<p id="p3">First novel I've read in a long time, and I'm proud that I did! This story is a psychological, often dark, and always
				thorough, look into the mind of a man obsessing over a women he thinks he knows. We hear plenty about his sadness, his
				thoughts, his anxieties and concerns. Bit hard to get through at times, but I think it's worth it. I like how it made
				me feel a range of emotions, made me empathise with the characters, and painted vivid pictures using great descriptive
				language. Think those are signs of a good book.</p>
			<img src="img/bigmagic.jpg" alt="Front cover of Big Magic: Creative Living Beyond Fear by Elizabeth Gilbert" aria-describedby="p4">
			<p>Big Magic: Creative Living Beyond Fear - Elizabeth Gilbert</p>
			<p id="p4">Where can I start with this book. I've never highlighted a book so many times, never read something and thought "yes,
				I do that" or "that's me!" so many times. This book contains messages that I will never forget. Messages that people
				are probably generally aware of, but that get buried under fear, anxiety, lack of confidence, doubt etc. It's a rare
				thing for me to read something and feel so confident that it has changed my life for the better. But this one has. The
				wise, funny and completely relatable Liz Gilbert has an honest, no-bullshit conversation with you. A conversation that
				feels like it's over coffee and she's known you for years. Thank goodness for people like her.</p>
			<img src="img/womenandpower.jpg" alt="Women and Power by Mary Beard" aria-describedby="p5">
			<p>Women and Power: A Manifesto by Mary Beard</p>
			<p id="p5">A short and thought-provoking book. Mary Beard deconstructs some of the history behind the lack of women in power today.
				She uses clever and interesting analogies and brings together pieces of information that I am sure people who aren't
				looking might miss. I wish it would have been longer. Definitely a good read for anybody curious about the balance of
				power between men and women in various positions.</p>
			<img src="img/psychologyfordesigners.jpg" alt="Psychology for Designers by Joe Leech" aria-describedby="p6">
			<p>Psychology for Designers by Joe Leech</p>
			<p id="p6">A sweet and short introduction to psychology and design. Joe tells us his story, his experience with academic psychology
				and human computer interaction. He provides many examples and resources. Reminded me a lot of my own academic studies
				in psychology. My favourite part was at the end of the book in 'Extras' where he talks about myths and key findings in
				those areas of psychology that are most important to design. I particularly like the idea of mental models. A really
				nice little book. There are some spelling and grammar mistakes but I'm personally nitpicky about that stuff.</p>
			<img src="img/real.jpg" alt="Real - the inside-out guide to being yourself by Clare Dimond" aria-describedby="p7">
			<p>Real - The Inside-out Guide to Being Yourself by Clare Dimond</p>
			<p id="p7">At risk of sounding cliché... where has this book been all my life? I've never read such a pure, real or beautiful book.
				I repeat the words inside it to myself daily... "There is only the moment, we are merely an idea of a self, thoughts
				rushing through us like waves. We only exist in the prescence of another. We need nothing, we are already all we'll ever
				need". Another life-changing book for me. Absolutely and completely.</p>
			<img src="img/oneofthosefaces.jpg" alt="A Man with One of Those Faces by Caimh McDonnell" aria-describedby="p7">
			<p>A Man with One of Those Faces by Caimh McDonnell</p>
			<p id="p7">I'm not one to usually go for crime novels, but the prologue made me laugh so I gave it a go. A great thing about this
				book is that it's set in Ireland and that the author has portrayed everyone's accents and personalities perfectly. The
				characters are great. I love the way the story twists and turns and is really not that predictable at all. Looking forward
				to reading the next three books in the series!</p>
			<img src="img/daythatnevercomes.jpg" alt="The Day That Never Comes by Caimh McDonnell" aria-describedby="p8">
			<p>The Day That Never Comes by Caimh McDonnell</p>
			<p id="p8">Just as funny and surprising as the prequel!</p>
			<img src="img/curious-charms.jpg" alt="The Curious Charms of Arthur Pepper by Phaedra Patrick" aria-describedby="p9">
			<p>The Curious Charms of Arthur Pepper by Phaedra Patrick</p>
			<p id="p9">A lovely book that had lots of English-y things for me to identify with. It is very centered around communication between
				family members and about the struggles normal people face. There were lots of moments that had me nodding my head and
				feeling emotional - especially where Arthur was reflecting about his life. Really glad I picked this little gem up.</p>
			<img src="img/howtostoptime.jpg" alt="How To Stop Time by Matt Haig" aria-describedby="p10">
			<p>How To Stop Time by Matt Haig</p>
			<p id="p10">Saw a friend reading this on Sunday afternoon, July 8th and by Tuesday evening, July 10th I had finished it. Beautifully
				and poignantly written. I could barely put it down and couldn't wait to pick it up again. I got lost in the fascination
				of a person's experience through time. Great messages in the book as well. I am sure anyone would enjoy many of the quotes
				in there. I loved it, loved it, loved it. <em>Even</em> if it rather often reminded me of a movie script.</p>
